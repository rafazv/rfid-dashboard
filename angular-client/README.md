## Before You Begin

Before you begin check about the basic building blocks that assemble a Angular application:

- Angular - Angular's [Official Website](https://angular.io/) is a great starting point.
- Angular CLI - Go through [Angular CLI Official Website](https://cli.angular.io/) and check their [Overview Page](https://angular.io/cli)

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

- Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.
- Angular CLI - [Install Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)

## Quick Install

To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running Your Application

Run your application using npm:

```bash
npm start
```

Your application runs on port 4200 with the _development_ environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
